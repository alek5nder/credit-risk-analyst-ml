# ðŸ§  Credit Risk Analyst

This project analyzes the **German Credit Data** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to predict whether a client represents a **good** or **bad** credit risk.  
It applies **machine learning models** and **feature engineering techniques** to build a transparent and interpretable scoring model.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

Credit risk modeling is a key task in the banking sector â€” it helps institutions estimate the probability of loan default and make data-driven lending decisions.  
This project explores the German Credit dataset, performs preprocessing and feature selection, and compares several classification models.
